# Countries-Statistics-Comparison
Website developed in PHP as part of the BBK MSc Assignment 

Website where user can select up to four countries and some aspects about it. 

Was developed in PHP to get the information from a JSON file and print a table dynamically with the results. 

Also I used a JavaScript chart library to represent the results on the bottom.
